        <img src="images/photoofgraceandv.JPG" alt="A picture of Grace" width="250"> 
        <p>Hi! My name is Grace, and I'm an adventurous, kind, and curious person. I have a wonderful family, amazing friends, and many interests that make life exciting!</p>

        <h2>My Family</h2>
        <p>I have three awesome siblings who always keep things fun and exciting. We love spending time together, whether we’re playing games, hiking, or just hanging out. I also have a loyal dog named Remy, who follows me everywhere!</p>

        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sports:</strong> I play both basketball and soccer. I love being active and working with my teammates to win games!</li>
            <li><strong>Hiking:</strong> Exploring nature and going on adventures is one of my favorite things to do.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking:</strong> I enjoy making cookies and trying out new recipes in the kitchen.</li>
            <li><strong>Coding:</strong> I'm currently learning how to code, and I love solving problems and creating new projects!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My School</h2>
        <p>I go to an awesome school where I get to learn new things every day. My favorite subjects are math and science because I enjoy problem-solving and discovering how things work.</p>
        
             
        
        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
        <p>When I grow up, I have two big dreams:</p>
        
            <li><strong>Become an ER Doctor:</strong> I want to work in the emergency room, helping people when they need it the most. I love the idea of making a difference and being able to save lives.</li>
            <li><strong>Move Overseas:</strong> I would love to experience life in another country, exploring new cultures, meeting new people, and maybe even working as a doctor in a different part of the world!</li>
        




            

        <p>Thanks for getting to know me! I can’t wait to see where life takes me.</p>
